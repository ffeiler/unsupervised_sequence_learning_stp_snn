# ICONS Paper Details

This repository contains the implementation deetails for the paper titled "Unsupervised Learning of Spatio-Temporal Patterns in Spiking Neuronal Networks" that will be published in the proceedings of ICONS (International Conference on Neural Systems).

- Neuron Models: The neuron and synapse models used in this paper can be found in the `nestml_models` directory. Each model is implemented as a separate file and includes the necessary code for simulating the behavior of the neurons in nestml.
- Simulation Configurations: The configuration files for all the simulations conducted in this paper can be found in the `configs` directory. Each configuration file specifies the parameters and settings used for a particular simulation.
